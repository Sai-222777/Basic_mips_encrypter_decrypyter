# Basic_mips_encrypter_decrypyter
 A program built on MIPS architecture that encodes and decodes a string of input based on the user's choice. 
 The assembler 'MIPS_asm.py' output is generated in an output file 'dump2.txt'. One can verify the correctness of the
 binary code generated by passing this file as an input to the MIPS simulator used to run 'mips_encrypt_decrypt.asm'.
The maximum length of the string that can be encoded is given on line number 29 (in 'mips_encrypt_decrypt.asm') and can be increased or decreased.
